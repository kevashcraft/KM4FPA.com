Hello, World!

Today I'm going to setup [km4fpa.com](https://www.km4fpa.com), again. This will be the second edition of the site and will hopefully keep progressing.

Today I put a 6 element vhf yagi 30' up in the air for an initial experiment into dxing on the 2m band. The radio was much quieter than I'd have hoped when I fist listened, but I've spent the past several hours researching vhf distance expectations.

Thanks for the read!
