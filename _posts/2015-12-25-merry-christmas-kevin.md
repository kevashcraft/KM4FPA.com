This Christmas I got a gift that made me more excited than any other I'd received in my now thirty years of life; I got my very first HF radio! It's an ICOM IC-7100 and is a very cool modern radio with a micro usb connection for easy computer control.

There's a lot more to come for this radio; right now all I have is a power supply and VHF/UHF antenna. I've built a few ground-planes and a yagi, but nothing for over 2 meters.
