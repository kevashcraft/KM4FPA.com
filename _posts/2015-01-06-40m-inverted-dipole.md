There's just so many options. Kinda. My lot is 130'x50' with a tree in the front yard and back, both about 30' max.

So the question is what do I want? Well, honestly I'm writing this a few weeks after the fact and am looking back with 20/20 vision. So what did I want? What happened?

Well I was insterested in a lot of things (yagi's, sdr's, finally getting on the hf air) and I had a hard time focusing on just one. This led me to cutting down a few tangling branches, stringing strings as high as I could, and building a couple of yagi's for the tower as well as sticking a raspberry pi in a 4" stub of pvc and raising it up.

Luckily one of the projects was a 40m inverted v. This antenna is a stub of pvc where rg58 coax meets two 14awg 1/4l long pieces of wire that are tied down at the ends. Most of the other projects turned out to be fun learning experiences but nothing worthwhile to keep up, except for this antenna.

I do not have an antenna tuner, but the 7100 does have a built-in swr meter that will measure from 1:1 to 1:3+ so if I get the design close then I can tune it with trial and error, trimming the length.

This antenna, after I trimmed another couple of branches and made sure the wires were taught and clear of obstructions, was within range of the ICOM's swr meter and I was able to get a 1:1 match at 7.15MHz after trimming a foot and a half or so off each end.

I'm located in Florida and can clearly hear stations in the South East US (AL, GA, SC). This makes sense because of the low height of the antenna (peak at 20') causes a high takeoff angle. 

The next morning I heard the South Cars net for the first time and was able to get a signal report from a station in Alabama (five-by-nine :).
