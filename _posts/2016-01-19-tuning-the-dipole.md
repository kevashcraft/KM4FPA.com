Getting an antenna to work without an antenna tuner is a confusing, tricky project. The radio (IC-7100) has an swr meter but it only shows 1:1 to 1:3 with a fuzzy meter for everything above, so if the antenna is not close to the target frequency there's not much useful information. Also, the radio only transmits in the amateur bands so there's no way (which would be illegal anyway) to keep looking for the frequency that antenna is currently resonate on to even get a baring to calculate the needed adjustments.

So, what do? Well, after fixing a couple of big issues that were causing a high swr on their own (antenna laying on tree branch, wire caught between fence posts, shoddy solder joint), the antenna which was cut to the right length (468/freq) was within the meter's range! The swr was too high at 7.15MHz (center of the 40m band) but the radio showed the ressonate frequency was somewhere a bit below 7MHz. So I looked at an antenna length chart to get an idea of the difference in length between 6.8ish and 7.15MHz antennas then trimmed the wires accordingly.

And then after doing that a couple more times things were right spot on! I had to do this again when I attached the additional wire to work 80m and ran into some difficulties when I was getting a really high swr but couldn't figure out why and didn't know what the antenna was doing. Luckily after inspecting all of the conections and untangling a string from the tree the antenna was back on the meter and after a few more dropping and raising the arms the copper was tuned and was matching 1:1 on 7.15MHz and 3.94MHz (an NTS net operates here). So YAY!!!

The next step will be setting it up to change lengths without having to raise and lower the arms...
