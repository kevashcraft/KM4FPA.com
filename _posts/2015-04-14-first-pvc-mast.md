Since I learned about line-of-sight and how height was everything when it came to radio reception. There's a [great repeater system](http://wp.ni4ce.org) here that I could keyup the near-by station but couldn't reach any of the other locations with my 5watt baofeng.

I wanted to be a Net Control Station (NCS) and one of the requirements (really the only one) was that you'd be able to reach multiple repeater stations. This is why I built the first tower.

We started with PVC. Originally I was trying a thick base as a loading shaft, and then progressed to using some fishing line (300lb thread for $25 on ebay, one of my most used radio purchases) to pull up the different sections. The function worked exactly as I'd hoped and 30' worth of PVC stretched into the sky... but that puppy leaned. A lot.

So after the initial setup, the tower stayed at 20' so it'd be stable but even there it worked perfectly as I needed! At the top was a 2m ground plane (light weight, 4 wires + barell connector) so it didn't have too much trouble keeping it up.

Some of the things I tried with the pvc: using guy wire (the fishing line) - this worked stabilized the top at 20' but still didn't allow me to go above 30', pulling it up horizontally (not as a telescope) - the pvc does not like that much tension.

In the end I learned that pvc is good for up to 20' for temporary setups.
