    <p>The other day I was walking through the store and saw EMT (electrical metal tubing). When I sat 10’ metal pipes for less than $5 I was imidiately interested! They were in 1/2” ($1.70), 3/4” ($2.60), 1” ($6.40), and 1 1/2” ($13).</p>

<p>I first tried the 1/2” inside the 3/4” and was able to get to 20’ easily (they were mounted to the ground with a 5’ 1/2” piece driven into the Earth). This setup worked well for holding up the next couple of antennas that I was working on, one of which was a vhf yagi (3’ x 6’).</p>

<p>Progressing on the obvious next step was to get the 1” pipe for the base and increase the height by 10’. This worked great and the ground plane that I moved back to (the yagi’s are tricky without a tuner) was able to get to 30’ and stay there throughout a windy day.</p>

<p>In addition to being strong enough to hold up some light antennas the tubing it light and able to be lifted up horizontally or telescoped up from the top of a ladder.</p>

<p>This tower has become my permanent main structure and acts as the mast for the 2m ground plane and holds up the center of the 80m dipole. It stays at about 25’ but doesn’t mind going up to 30’ (especially with the arms of the dipole guying it).</p>

<p>The design:</p>

<p>One pole inside of the other, overlapped by about a foot. Using either a clamp to keep the upper pipe up, or drilling holes and using bolts to lock the pipes tightly together. I found that driving a full 10’ length of the 2nd sized pipe worked best as a base (ie 3/4” base if the thickest pipe is 1”).</p>

<p>I built one other mast that was 20’ to hold up the arm of the dipole and guyed to handle the lateral tension.</p>
