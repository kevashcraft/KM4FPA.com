# First Digital Contact

## Antenna/Frequency
Dipole on 20m

## Scenario
On twitter I was looking through #HamRadio to find some new people to follow. I found [@NicholasGurley](https://twitter.com/NicholasGurley) and he followed me back. Then he asked if I'd had any luck making a digital contact. At the time I didn't have fldigi setup yet, but told him I would work on it. A couple of weeks later I got things configured and we setup a time to make contact.

## Contact
[KM4EPR (Nick Nick)](http://km4epr.com/) helped my find the right place to listen on the water fall and gave me an example of what a normal PSK31 contact looks like. We had a quick QSO, after 15 minutes of trying to find each other (like I said, this was my first time), that was mostly and excited echange at getting things to work.
