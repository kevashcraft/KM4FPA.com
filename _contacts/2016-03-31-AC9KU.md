# Answering Chicago

## Antenna/Frequency
Dipole on 20m

## Scenario
I had just modified the 80m dipole, disconnecting 3/4 of the wire so that it was resonant on 20 meters. I listened around 7.15MHz until I heard someone calling CQ CQ

## Contact
[AC9KU (George)](http://www.qrz.com/db/AC9KU/) was in contest mode and calling CQ. When I responded he gave me a quick signal report and said hello from Chicago!
