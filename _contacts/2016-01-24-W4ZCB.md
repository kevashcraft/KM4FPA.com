# My First Contact

## Antenna
It had been almost a month since I got my first HF radio. After a lot of research and learning, today I finally got my first antenna setup. It's a **40m inverted-vee** hung from a tree branch about 20' in the air.

## Tuning
It took about 5 round-trips between the radio and the backyard, but the SWR meter was finally showing a good match at 7.15MHz. I decided to try for a signal test, being very new to HF and not totally sure of the protocal, I keyed up the mic and just said **"This is KM4FPA testing"**.

## Contact
My first reaction when [W4ZVB (Harold)](http://www.qrz.com/db/W4ZCB/) responded was complete surprise. I almost couldn't believe someone was responding to **my very first transmission**!

## QSO
The QSO was fairly brief, but not as brief as a contest contact. I told him he was my first and he asked what antenna I'd setup. He told me that he'd been spending the day with his grandkids. I gave my thanks for responding and bid him 73, and that was about that.
