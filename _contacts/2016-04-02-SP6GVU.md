# My First DX Contact!

## Antenna/Frequency
Dipole on 40m

## Scenario
I had just modified the 80m dipole, adding a physical switch so I could more easily disconnect sections and change bands. I was listening around and heard someone calling CQ CQ.

## Contact
[SP6GVU (Andrzej)](http://www.qrz.com/db/SP6GVU/) was in contest mode and calling CQ. When I responded he gave me a quick signal report and said hello from Poland! This was my first contact with someone outside of the United States and he said my signal was nice and strong!
